# Quick Sort

## Target User

- Advanced Beginner or Intermediate

## Why I wrote this

- To organize knowledge

## how is this important?

- Quick Sort is important when you feel your program is slow
- You can sort a lot of data in an array quickly imcomparison to other sort algorithm such as bubble sort and insertion sort.

## what are some recommended links if the user wants to read more

- see recources I wrote at the end of this article.


## Algorithms

- Divide and conquer algorithms
  - That devide one big problem into two small problems and do same things following process.
  - To combine all small problems that are devided.
