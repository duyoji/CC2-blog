# My first public presentation.

## My experience.

Needless to say, I was so nervous. It was my first presentation in public in English also I've nerver done any public presentations in Japanese.
I spent a long time for preparing my slides and a workshop material and I had rehearsal for my presentation twice. I think it's kind of enough but I was feeling uncomfortable until the end of my presentation.
So I want to share my experience of this If you think of doing presentation in your second language first time.

## Targets of this article

## What unexpectedly easy was

Actually, I was uncomfortable until the end of my presentation. So I tried to talk with audience before I start to make me calm and it works for me.

- People who I talked with looked smiley and I could have eye-contact to them many times.

## What unexpectedly difficult was

I preapred lerning material for my workshop and wrote down how to install necessary environment to do the material.
I thought most of them had already finished setting up environment but, It was opposite in real. So I had to change my original plan to demonstrate how to use the material to learn.
